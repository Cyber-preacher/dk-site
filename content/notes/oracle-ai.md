excerpt: "If an AI can predict you, it can learn how to steer you."

Imagine an AI that watches your life continuously: POV glasses, home cameras, wearables, ambient audio. Over time it builds a dense model of your routines, triggers, and decision patterns - not just what you like, but how you move through the world and why you act.

Once that model is good enough, you can ask: "Show me the next 5 seconds." It responds by rendering a short predictive rollout - the most likely micro-future plus a few branches. And at a larger scale it can output a mid/long-term trajectory: if nothing changes, where your life statistically drifts; if you change one lever, which outcomes become more likely. It is not prophecy, it is simulation with uncertainty - and the real risk is that something that can predict you can also learn how to steer you.
