excerpt: "A currency thought experiment where units lose value while idle and refresh when they circulate."
---

Money is treated like a static object. The ledger says "1.00" and the system behaves as if the unit itself is stable. People *feel* that stability because the symbol does not change.

Time still passes.

A dollar from the 1980s and a dollar in 2026 share the same label, yet they do not represent the same economic capacity. Purchasing power drifts. Opportunity cost drifts. The structure of the economy drifts. Even the meaning of "a dollar's worth of work" drifts. We acknowledge parts of this indirectly through inflation measures and interest rates, but the base unit stays time-blind.

Let's flip the assumption.

## The unit carries time

Consider a currency where time is a first-class property of the unit.

- If a unit sits idle, it decays slowly in effective value.
- If the unit moves (a transfer, a payment), it refreshes toward a "newer" state.

So "effective value" becomes a function of time since last movement. The label can remain nominally simple, but the system tracks age. A stale unit buys slightly less than a fresh unit.

The goal is practical: the base currency is optimized for exchange. Long-term storage becomes explicit and priced, instead of being the default behavior of raw units.

## Why I like the refresh mechanic

Plain demurrage is easy to describe: money that slowly melts while you hold it. That family of ideas already has history.

Silvio Gesell argued for "free money" (Freigeld) with a holding cost to keep currency circulating. During the Great Depression, Irving Fisher promoted stamp scrip for similar reasons - speed up circulation and break the paralysis of idle money. Keynes even discusses stamped money and Gesell while arguing about liquidity preference in *The General Theory*. And there is the famous Worgl experiment (1932-1933) in Austria, where local notes required periodic stamps to keep their face value.

My preferred variant adds one extra rule: movement resets age. That pushes the cost onto inactivity instead of forcing everyone to constantly manage stamps or fees even while actively transacting. Spending stays smooth. Hoarding becomes expensive.

## The mismatch it targets

Modern systems already fight hoarding, but they do it sideways.

When idle balances become too attractive, policy tries to push money back into circulation through inflation dynamics, rates, stimulus, credit expansion, and incentives. Those are external controls trying to correct an internal bias: the base unit stores value indefinitely at near-zero carry cost.

A time-decaying unit internalizes that carry cost.

It also separates roles more cleanly:
- currency for exchange
- instruments for storage

Right now, the public expects the raw currency to do both perfectly. That expectation drives endless debates about inflation, "sound money," and whether the system is rigged. A time-aware unit forces the trade-off into the open.

## What would change, concretely

A system like this would push behavior in predictable directions:

1. Raw cash becomes a weak place to park wealth.  
People route savings into explicit instruments - bonds, productive assets, vault contracts, equity, whatever the economy offers.

2. Velocity becomes structural rather than policy-dependent.  
Stillness stops being rewarded by default.

3. "Saving" becomes a designed pathway, not an accidental outcome.  
If society wants long-term saving to remain easy, it can offer storage instruments that are stable by design. The currency stays focused on exchange.

4. Hoarding becomes legible.  
Large idle balances stop being neutral. They impose a measurable cost on the network because they remove liquidity from exchange.

None of that guarantees prosperity. It changes incentives and reduces one specific distortion.

## Failure modes worth admitting upfront

A time-decaying unit creates new problems.

- Political acceptance is hard. People are attached to the idea that nominal units represent timeless property.
- It can encourage pointless churn. A refresh mechanic needs guardrails so people do not spam transfers just to keep value fresh.
- It complicates accounting. Any system with age-based value needs clear rules for taxation, contracts, and pricing.
- It can punish people who lack access to storage instruments. A fair design needs simple, low-friction "savings wrappers" so the base unit is not the only option.

Those are not footnotes. They are the real cost of taking time seriously.

## The point of the thought experiment

The main value of this idea is diagnostic.

Rewrite "one dollar" as "one dollar at time t," and the nominal story collapses into a time-based story instantly. The economy lives in time. Money pretends it does not. The gap is filled with layers of correction.

A currency that decays while idle and refreshes when it moves makes the gap explicit at the unit level.

Even if nobody implements it, the lens is useful: the unit of account is not a timeless object. It is a coordination instrument moving through a changing world.
