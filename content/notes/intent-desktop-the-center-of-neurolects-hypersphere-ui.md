excerpt: "A consumer BCI desktop should stabilize intent, not force constant micro-navigation."
---

A mouse-based desktop assumes the user will manually route their attention: pick a window, aim a cursor, click the right thing, repeat. A consumer BCI breaks that assumption. If the UI still demands constant micro-navigation, the experience turns into noise: tiny impulses get misread as actions, focus keeps slipping, and the user starts managing the interface instead of doing the work.

Neurolect's hypersphere UI needs a different center of gravity. For me, that center is the intent desktop, not a wallpaper with icons, but a workspace built around one idea: intent is the primary object, and the system's job is to keep it stable. The intent desktop is where Neurolect learns what I'm trying to accomplish, holds that context, and shapes the flow so I don't bounce between apps just because my attention briefly drifted.

In practice, it's less about opening applications and more about maintaining a task state. Tools should come and go without forcing me to rebuild context each time. Switching should be deliberate, not twitchy. The interface should feel anchored, like it's protecting attention instead of competing for it.

What I want from an intent desktop is boring reliability:

- default resistance to micro-intents: commit only when intent is clear
- context continuity: tools change, task frame stays
- intent routing: the same intent maps to different tools depending on workflow phase
- cheap recovery: undo switches, rewind, pin a workspace
- explicit anchors: a simple way to say "stay here" or "follow me"

If Neurolect gets this right, the desktop stops being a place you operate and becomes a place that quietly stays aligned with what you mean. Less jumping. Less friction. More uninterrupted thought.
