The planet looks balanced because the virus already ate it.

No constant mass death, no endless fever scenes. Just a biosphere where every species is, at some level, viral biomass - a moving, breathing substrate that the same replicator lives inside. Forests, oceans, animals, microbes. Different shapes, one underlying tenant.

The virus does not benefit from wiping its hosts. It benefits from keeping them inside a narrow operating window where there is always enough biomass, always enough contact, always enough turnover. So it pushes the whole world toward a steady equilibrium that serves replication. A planet-wide setpoint.

The mechanism is boring in the way real control systems are boring. Most of the time the virus is latent. It does nothing. Then density and stress cross a threshold, and it flips modes. Not "kill mode" - regulation mode. Fertility down for a season. Appetite shifts. Aggression damped. Sleep gets deeper. Immune tone changes. Whole populations slide into different metabolic states so the ecosystem stops overshooting and crashing.

Over long timescales the line between host and virus disappears. Viral sequences sit inside genomes as normal infrastructure. Development assumes them. Immunity learns them.

The biosphere is stable because one replicator found the simplest strategy for infinite survival: take everything, connect everything, and keep the planet running at the replication optimum forever.
