excerpt: "Early contact is more likely to arrive as protocol, not proximity."

If we ever encounter extraterrestrial intelligence, there’s a decent chance we won’t “meet” them in person for a long time. The practical reasons are boring but decisive: distance, time delay, logistics, and risk. Even if two civilizations become aware of each other, sending bodies (or ships) is expensive, slow, and politically complicated. Sending information is cheaper. So the earliest phase of contact would likely be mediated: signals, protocols, shared formats, and eventually richer telepresence.

That opens an interesting possibility: an established, highly developed communication layer that many civilizations already use - a kind of “galactic commons.” Not necessarily a literal VR game, but an interoperable space where civilizations can exchange knowledge, negotiate, trade culture, and maintain identity without physical proximity. If something like that exists, our first step into the wider ecosystem might look less like a historic handshake and more like onboarding: authentication, translation, reputation, security constraints, and then a presence - maybe text at first, then audio, then simulated environments, avatars, or whatever equivalents make sense across species. Of course, it might not exist at all. But if it does, humanity’s first true interstellar gathering place could be a networked world we join long before we ever share the same sky.
