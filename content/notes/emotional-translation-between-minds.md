excerpt: "Emotions are not a universal codec; translation needs a local interpreter on both ends."

If brain-computer interfaces ever grow into anything like a real communication medium, I do not believe "raw emotion streaming" will be the first thing that works. Not because it is undesirable, but because emotion is not a universal codec.

My sadness is not your sadness. Even if two brains light up a similar region, the lived meaning behind that activation can be different, and stimulating a pattern that resembles my affect might trigger something adjacent in you, or something entirely wrong. The naive model assumes emotions are labels you can transmit. The reality is that emotions are personal coordinates inside a private internal space.

So if we imagine emotional transfer, the only plausible architecture is not one AI, but two.

On each side sits a local model that knows its user intimately. It is trained on that user's patterns, history, habits, context, and the way their brain expresses internal states across time. It becomes a personal interpreter.

When I try to "send" an emotion, my local AI does not ship sadness as a universal object. It exports an intent and a structured description in a standardized intermediate representation, something like:

- the direction of affect (downward, agitated, flat, relieved)
- the intensity and volatility
- the cognitive framing (loss, shame, longing, nostalgia, betrayal)
- the bodily signature (tightness, fatigue, heat, restlessness)
- the confidence and uncertainty

Then that packet goes to your local AI. And your local AI has one job: decide what it means for you.

## There are two fundamentally different goals

### 1) Recreate what I feel, literally

This is the romantic idea - make you feel "my sadness".

But if your emotional manifold is shaped differently, the closest point to my sadness might land in a different neighborhood for you. The output could be grief, anger, numbness, panic, or even something pleasant if the mapping is badly aligned. Direct recreation is high bandwidth but high risk. It demands extremely careful calibration, shared references, and consent controls that go far beyond current thinking.

### 2) Recreate the equivalent meaning, not the same sensation

This is the pragmatic idea - find the semantic sibling of my emotion inside you.

Your local AI asks: "When this person says they feel X, what is the closest experience in this user's own history that carries the same shape of meaning?" Not the same brain pattern, not the same chemical profile, but the same story.

You do not feel my sadness. You feel your sadness that best matches what my sadness is pointing at. That sounds less pure, but it may actually be more honest, because it respects that you are not me.

It also mirrors how human empathy already works. We do not truly import another person's inner state. We approximate it through our own archive of experiences, then we act as if that approximation is close enough to matter.

The question is not "can we transmit emotion?" The question is "what does it mean to understand someone when the substrate of feeling is not shared?"

That is the real translation problem. The rest is engineering.
